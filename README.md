# Windturbine-Simulation-package
WindSim stands for Windturbine Simulation package. It models the most important aerodynamic (i.e. BEM, stall, aerodynamic damping) and dynamic features (in the form of “mass-spring-damper” systems) of modern wind turbines, so realistic simulations can be performed. See Descriptions for detailed information on the applied models. All main wind turbine components (rotor, tower, transmission and generator) are included. WindSim can be used in order to learn about the dynamics of wind turbines; to design a control system; to do a (simple) fatigue analysis (e.g. in order to do a sanity check on a fatigue analysis using a state-of-the-art package).

WindSim is available both as Matlab (optimization and control toolbox required) and Python version.
